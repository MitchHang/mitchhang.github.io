This was surprising to me, as this is one of three play types that Maryland seems to be focusing on during football, whereas the other seven listed have less than 10 occurrences from 2019 to 2023. This makes me think that because Maryland focuses on the pass receptions, rushes/runs and pass incompletions, they would often do well in games, but because they aren’t focusing on anything else, they would come up less than stellar in games. So it’s honestly a bit of a mixed bag here.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=third_and_six_md_grouped, \n    aes(x=reorder(play_type, count),\n        weight=count)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma) + \n  labs(\n    title=\"Maryland's dominant play from 2019 to 2023 is pass receptions\", \n    x=\"Type of play\", \n    y=\"Count (from 2019 to 2023\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  coord_flip()"

We can see that Miami has scored over 140 plays within the redzone, and it has resulted in an overall EPA score of 12.3, a slight increase (about 36.6%) from the first three weeks.\n\n\nCode\nplay_by_play_2022_p2 &lt;- play_by_play_2022 |&gt;\n  filter(yardline_100 &lt;= 20) |&gt;\n  filter(play_type %in% qualified_plays) |&gt;\n  filter(posteam == \"MIA\") |&gt;\n  drop_na(yardline_100) |&gt;\n  group_by(posteam) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    redzone_plays = n(),\n    epa = sum(epa)\n  )\n\nplay_by_play_2022_p2\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  posteam redzone_plays   epa\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 MIA               147  12.3\n\n\nHere I am creating two separate dataframes for all NFL teams in 2022 with the total number of redzone plays and total EPA for both the first 3 weeks and through 8 weeks, all before joining them into one greater dataframe.\n\n\nCode\nplay_by_play_2022_3weeks &lt;- play_by_play_2022 |&gt;\n  filter(week &lt;= 3, yardline_100 &lt;= 20) |&gt;\n  filter(play_type %in% qualified_plays) |&gt;\n  drop_na(yardline_100) |&gt;\n  group_by(posteam) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    redzone_plays_3weeks = n(),\n    epa_3weeks = sum(epa)\n  )\n\nplay_by_play_2022_8weeks &lt;- play_by_play_2022 |&gt;\n  filter(week &lt;= 8, yardline_100 &lt;= 20) |&gt;\n  filter(play_type %in% qualified_plays) |&gt;\n  drop_na(yardline_100) |&gt;\n  group_by(posteam) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    redzone_plays_8weeks = n(),\n    epa_8weeks = sum(epa)\n  )\n\n\nplay_by_play_2022_3_and_8weeks &lt;- play_by_play_2022_3weeks |&gt; left_join(play_by_play_2022_8weeks)\n\n\nJoining with `by = join_by(posteam)`\n\n\nHere I am creaing a dumbbell plot showing the change in EPA for the major football teams, with the green dots representing Week 3 EPA and the blue dots representing Week 8 EPA. We can see that\nAlthough the Kansas City Chiefs had the highest EPA after eight weeks, the team with the greatest overall change in EPA from three to eight weeks is the Minnesota Vikings, as there is a 229% increase from the Week 3 EPA to the Week 8 EPA (one value was in the negative while the other was in the positive). In addition, despite the Denver Broncos having the lowest EPA after eight week, the team with the worst overall change in EPA during the same period is the Jacksonville Jaguars, as there is a 524.2% decrease from the Week 3 EPA to the Week 8 EPA. If we check on the Miami Dolphins, we see that despite there not being much of a change between the EPA values for Week 3 and Week 8 compared to the other teams, the values are relatively high. It’s possible that the Miami Dolphins are consistent in their efforts of plays from Weeks 3 and 8, whereas the Minnesota Vikings were pushing a lot harder in their plays. Meanwhile, the Jacksonville Jaguars likely couldn’t boost their effort in plays (or at least keep it as consistent as possible) from Weeks 3 and 8, as other teams have often outsmarted and outplayed them during their games.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=play_by_play_2022_3_and_8weeks, \n    aes(y=reorder(posteam, epa_8weeks), x=epa_3weeks, xend=epa_8weeks),\n    linewidth = 1,\n    size=1,\n    color = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"blue\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  labs(title=\"Minnesota bears highest EPA leap after 8 weeks\", subtitle=\"Despite the Kansas City chiefs having the highest number of expected points added (EPA) after eight weeks \\nof in-season games, the Minnesota Vikings have the greatest overall increase in its EPA, with a 229% \\nincrease from Week 3 to Week 8 (green = Week 3 EPA, blue = Week 8 EPA).\", caption=\"Source: NFL | By Mitchell Hang\")  + theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\nWarning in geom_dumbbell(data = play_by_play_2022_3_and_8weeks, aes(y =\nreorder(posteam, : Ignoring unknown parameters: `linewidth`\n\n\nWarning: Using the `size` aesthetic with geom_segment was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use the `linewidth` aesthetic instead."

It can be considered that 2021 was their best year since their Defensive and Offensive Yards per Play were above and to the right of their respective axes – they are in the so-called positive-positive quadrant (I) – whereas 2022 appears to be the worst in recent years as they are in the negative-negative quadrant (III). I don’t think there’s an easy way to signify that the 2023 data is incomplete, as we already have tons of data from other teams that have already blended in with one another, but maybe making the point for 2023 a darker color could be a potential solution."

I begin by implementing the Big Ten filter category, selecting only the columns showing the full team name and the number of offensive plays for each game, and grouping by the full team name. Then, I use the summarise/ze function to create new columns showing the total number of offensive plays for each team, the number of games each team played during the season, and the calculated average number of offensive plays per game for each team. I then arranged the teams in descending order by the latter column, and we can see that the Purdue Boilermakers have a wide lead for their total offensive plays, thereby resulting them having the highest average offensive plays per game during the 2022 season, as there is about one play separating the Boilermakers and the Northwestern Wildcats and half a play separating the Wildcats and the Indiana Hoosiers. I would say that these team results are relatively close to one another.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=logs_22_filtered, \n    aes(x=reorder(TeamFull, AvgOffensivePlaysPerGame),\n        weight=AvgOffensivePlaysPerGame)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma) + \n  labs(\n    title=\"Purdue out on top in average offensive plays for 2022\", \n    x=\"Team\", \n    y=\"Average # of offensive plays per game\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, I am constructing a stacked bar graph that shows the average number of offensive plays for each team in the Big Ten Conference for the 2022 college football season. I decided to go with a stacked bar graph because the names of the teams are quite long and they would cross into one another otherwise, and also because it will be easier to see any differences from one team to another rather than a regular (i.e., vertical) bar graph.\nThis graph, we can see that Purdue has the highest average number of offensive plays for all Big Ten colleges during the 2022 college football season. There are relatively small margins from one team to another on this graph, with the largest separation being between the Nebraska Cornhuskers and the Iowa Hawkeyes. Some teams have played for fewer games compared to Purdue (they have played the most, at 14 games) during the 2022 season, and it’s possible that the ranking would’ve changed had they played more games.\n\n\nCode\nlogs_23_filtered &lt;- logs_23 |&gt; \n  filter(TeamFull %in% big10) |&gt;\n  select(TeamFull, OffensivePlays) |&gt;\n  group_by(TeamFull) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    TotalOffensivePlays = sum(OffensivePlays),\n    GamesPlayed = n(),\n    AvgOffensivePlaysPerGame = (TotalOffensivePlays/GamesPlayed)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(AvgOffensivePlaysPerGame))\n\nshow(logs_23_filtered)\n\n\n# A tibble: 14 × 4\n   TeamFull               TotalOffensivePlays GamesPlayed AvgOffensivePlaysPer…¹\n   &lt;chr&gt;                                &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;int&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Penn State Nittany Li…                 403           5                   80.6\n 2 Purdue Boilermakers                    438           6                   73  \n 3 Wisconsin Badgers                      357           5                   71.4\n 4 Maryland Terrapins                     410           6                   68.3\n 5 Michigan State Sparta…                 338           5                   67.6\n 6 Illinois Fighting Ill…                 400           6                   66.7\n 7 Northwestern Wildcats                  399           6                   66.5\n 8 Indiana Hoosiers                       332           5                   66.4\n 9 Minnesota Golden Goph…                 382           6                   63.7\n10 Ohio State Buckeyes                    314           5                   62.8\n11 Rutgers Scarlet Knigh…                 373           6                   62.2\n12 Nebraska Cornhuskers                   372           6                   62  \n13 Michigan Wolverines                    358           6                   59.7\n14 Iowa Hawkeyes                          333           6                   55.5\n# ℹ abbreviated name: ¹​AvgOffensivePlaysPerGame\n\n\nHere, I am doing the exact same steps I used to mutate the 2022 dataset for the current 2023 dataset. Here, we can see that the Penn State Nittany Lions have overtaken the Purdue Boilermakers in average offensive plays per game in the 2023 season by about six plays. The Wisconsin Badgers have moved up considerably from last year’s ranking, as they are currently now behind Purdue by no more than two plays.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=logs_23_filtered, \n    aes(x=reorder(TeamFull, AvgOffensivePlaysPerGame),\n        weight=AvgOffensivePlaysPerGame)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma) + \n  labs(\n    title=\"Penn State overtakes Purdue in average offensive plays for 2023\", \n    x=\"Team\", \n    y=\"Average # of offensive plays per game\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we see that the Penn Stake Nittany Lions have currently dethroned the Purdue Boilermakers for having the highest average offensive plays for all Big Ten colleges in the 2023 college football season, and it’s evident from the graph that there’s a much wider margin between the top two teams compared to the top 2 and top 3 teams, top 3 and top 4 teams, etc. It can be assumed that Penn State was pushing more offensive plays in their games since being ranked sixth in average offensive plays from last year. Interestingly, if we go back to the tibble from earlier, Penn State has played five games whereas Purdue has played six, and Purdue has a few dozen more offensive plays than Penn State. It’s possible that the separation between the current top two teams in average offensive plays wil grow larger once Penn State completes their sixth game.\nIn conclusion, I thought this was an interesting exercise in creating bar graphs to tell a story about a certain college’s rise or fall in the sports world. I was honestly surprised to see Purdue lose their lead in average offensive plays for another team, considering how dominant they were in having the highest offensive plays during the 2022 college football season. Considering that the 2023 college football season is still in progress, it’s unknown if the ranking will remain as is or if Purdue (or another team) takes back their lead, and maybe another team will make a surprising move up or down from last year’s ranking."

Starting from Game 6 (October 7th), we start to see a slight decline in rushing performance before returning to some level slightly above the baseline. However, the most recent game on November 4th reveals Maryland’s worst rushing performance thus far in the season, as it is way below the baseline (less than -3 yards per carry). Interestingly enough, the first five games with the above average rushing performances were those in which Maryland won, whereas they lost in the following four games.\nWhen we compare Maryland’s rushing performance to other Big Ten teams during the same period, we can see that many of the other teams have different fluctuating (i.e., change from high to low) rushing performances in regards to the baseline, but Michigan seems to be the most consistent, as there is relatively little fluctuation and their first few games are rated above the baseline. The one graph that looks most similar to Maryland’s is Nebraska’s, as they both have above average rushing performances for games up to October 1st, followed by a slight decline before returning above the baseline, followed by another decline in rushing performance. It’s worth noting that Nebraska’s most recent rushing performance isn’t as bad as Maryland’s around the same time. However, the fact that Maryland’s most recent rushing performance falls far below not just the baseline but other teams in their recent games draws immediate concern, as it makes people wonder how they are doing so poorly in rushing, especially compared to their past performances in prior seasons.\nIf we analyze Maryland’s performance in the most recent game against Penn State alone, we can see that not only was their rushing performance below average, but also they had the fewest rushing attempts out of all games they played thus far (16). From this, it’s also worth noting that Maryland and Penn State games are often some of the most hyped within the universities, as the two have a growing football rivalry (largely helped by them currently being part of the same conference) going as far back as at least 1943, where both teams face up once a year in the fall, and Penn State wins most often. In fact, Penn State’s own sports website even chronicles many of their matches with Maryland in detail, mentioning that their longest winning streak lasted 24 games from 1962 to 1988, with the only times Maryland has won being in 1961, 2014 and 2020 (plus a tie in 1988). So it seems that Maryland losing to Penn State almost every year is perhaps a constant in life (something that might be presumed as inevitable despite the increased training), but once in a while, a miracle does happen and Maryland is able to pull out a victory (or at least tie).\nhttps://gopsusports.com/sports/football/opponent-history/university-of-maryland/44"
