This was surprising to me, as this is one of three play types that Maryland seems to be focusing on during football, whereas the other seven listed have less than 10 occurrences from 2019 to 2023. This makes me think that because Maryland focuses on the pass receptions, rushes/runs and pass incompletions, they would often do well in games, but because they aren’t focusing on anything else, they would come up less than stellar in games. So it’s honestly a bit of a mixed bag here.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=third_and_six_md_grouped, \n    aes(x=reorder(play_type, count),\n        weight=count)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma) + \n  labs(\n    title=\"Maryland's dominant play from 2019 to 2023 is pass receptions\", \n    x=\"Type of play\", \n    y=\"Count (from 2019 to 2023\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  coord_flip()"

It can be considered that 2021 was their best year since their Defensive and Offensive Yards per Play were above and to the right of their respective axes – they are in the so-called positive-positive quadrant (I) – whereas 2022 appears to be the worst in recent years as they are in the negative-negative quadrant (III). I don’t think there’s an easy way to signify that the 2023 data is incomplete, as we already have tons of data from other teams that have already blended in with one another, but maybe making the point for 2023 a darker color could be a potential solution."

I begin by implementing the Big Ten filter category, selecting only the columns showing the full team name and the number of offensive plays for each game, and grouping by the full team name. Then, I use the summarise/ze function to create new columns showing the total number of offensive plays for each team, the number of games each team played during the season, and the calculated average number of offensive plays per game for each team. I then arranged the teams in descending order by the latter column, and we can see that the Purdue Boilermakers have a wide lead for their total offensive plays, thereby resulting them having the highest average offensive plays per game during the 2022 season, as there is about one play separating the Boilermakers and the Northwestern Wildcats and half a play separating the Wildcats and the Indiana Hoosiers. I would say that these team results are relatively close to one another.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=logs_22_filtered, \n    aes(x=reorder(TeamFull, AvgOffensivePlaysPerGame),\n        weight=AvgOffensivePlaysPerGame)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma) + \n  labs(\n    title=\"Purdue out on top in average offensive plays for 2022\", \n    x=\"Team\", \n    y=\"Average # of offensive plays per game\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, I am constructing a stacked bar graph that shows the average number of offensive plays for each team in the Big Ten Conference for the 2022 college football season. I decided to go with a stacked bar graph because the names of the teams are quite long and they would cross into one another otherwise, and also because it will be easier to see any differences from one team to another rather than a regular (i.e., vertical) bar graph.\nThis graph, we can see that Purdue has the highest average number of offensive plays for all Big Ten colleges during the 2022 college football season. There are relatively small margins from one team to another on this graph, with the largest separation being between the Nebraska Cornhuskers and the Iowa Hawkeyes. Some teams have played for fewer games compared to Purdue (they have played the most, at 14 games) during the 2022 season, and it’s possible that the ranking would’ve changed had they played more games.\n\n\nCode\nlogs_23_filtered &lt;- logs_23 |&gt; \n  filter(TeamFull %in% big10) |&gt;\n  select(TeamFull, OffensivePlays) |&gt;\n  group_by(TeamFull) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    TotalOffensivePlays = sum(OffensivePlays),\n    GamesPlayed = n(),\n    AvgOffensivePlaysPerGame = (TotalOffensivePlays/GamesPlayed)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(AvgOffensivePlaysPerGame))\n\nshow(logs_23_filtered)\n\n\n# A tibble: 14 × 4\n   TeamFull               TotalOffensivePlays GamesPlayed AvgOffensivePlaysPer…¹\n   &lt;chr&gt;                                &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;int&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Penn State Nittany Li…                 403           5                   80.6\n 2 Purdue Boilermakers                    438           6                   73  \n 3 Wisconsin Badgers                      357           5                   71.4\n 4 Maryland Terrapins                     410           6                   68.3\n 5 Michigan State Sparta…                 338           5                   67.6\n 6 Illinois Fighting Ill…                 400           6                   66.7\n 7 Northwestern Wildcats                  399           6                   66.5\n 8 Indiana Hoosiers                       332           5                   66.4\n 9 Minnesota Golden Goph…                 382           6                   63.7\n10 Ohio State Buckeyes                    314           5                   62.8\n11 Rutgers Scarlet Knigh…                 373           6                   62.2\n12 Nebraska Cornhuskers                   372           6                   62  \n13 Michigan Wolverines                    358           6                   59.7\n14 Iowa Hawkeyes                          333           6                   55.5\n# ℹ abbreviated name: ¹​AvgOffensivePlaysPerGame\n\n\nHere, I am doing the exact same steps I used to mutate the 2022 dataset for the current 2023 dataset. Here, we can see that the Penn State Nittany Lions have overtaken the Purdue Boilermakers in average offensive plays per game in the 2023 season by about six plays. The Wisconsin Badgers have moved up considerably from last year’s ranking, as they are currently now behind Purdue by no more than two plays.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(\n    data=logs_23_filtered, \n    aes(x=reorder(TeamFull, AvgOffensivePlaysPerGame),\n        weight=AvgOffensivePlaysPerGame)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma) + \n  labs(\n    title=\"Penn State overtakes Purdue in average offensive plays for 2023\", \n    x=\"Team\", \n    y=\"Average # of offensive plays per game\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we see that the Penn Stake Nittany Lions have currently dethroned the Purdue Boilermakers for having the highest average offensive plays for all Big Ten colleges in the 2023 college football season, and it’s evident from the graph that there’s a much wider margin between the top two teams compared to the top 2 and top 3 teams, top 3 and top 4 teams, etc. It can be assumed that Penn State was pushing more offensive plays in their games since being ranked sixth in average offensive plays from last year. Interestingly, if we go back to the tibble from earlier, Penn State has played five games whereas Purdue has played six, and Purdue has a few dozen more offensive plays than Penn State. It’s possible that the separation between the current top two teams in average offensive plays wil grow larger once Penn State completes their sixth game.\nIn conclusion, I thought this was an interesting exercise in creating bar graphs to tell a story about a certain college’s rise or fall in the sports world. I was honestly surprised to see Purdue lose their lead in average offensive plays for another team, considering how dominant they were in having the highest offensive plays during the 2022 college football season. Considering that the 2023 college football season is still in progress, it’s unknown if the ranking will remain as is or if Purdue (or another team) takes back their lead, and maybe another team will make a surprising move up or down from last year’s ranking."
